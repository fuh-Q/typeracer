### <u>Typeracer in a terminal.</u>

### IMPORTANT STUFF
- Command to run the program >> **`java -cp "bin;lib/sqlite-jdbc-3.40.0.0.jar;lib/json-20220924.jar;lib/jnativehook-2.2.2.jar" "Main"`**

- Your terminal <u>**must**</u> support colour (ANSI escape codes)
- <u>**DO NOT**</u> run this in [repl.it](https://replit.com), it won't allow the program to register
the key listener, which is more or less the backbone of this CLI.
<br><br><u>Running it locally works just fine.</u>

#### How to play
- The main menu that appears when you enter the program
- That menu is controlled using your arrow keys [ `<` `^` `v` `>` ]
- There are two game modes, Quote and Random Words (read the note about Words below)
- The goal is to type the text given as fast as you can, when you finish, you'll be shown you accuracy and words per minute (WPM)
- To exit a test, press the ESC key twice

#### Note
You can press ESC twice to quit a game.

I'm pretty sure I downloaded the database for the random words mode from a Scrabble checker.
As you may or may not know, Scrabble players look for any excuse to write something off
as an actual English word, so that's to say that I'm not even sure if half the crap in that database
is even English looool
